### Introduction

If you are reading this, you have already set up GitHub classroom and have your own cloned version of this assignment.

This assignment is to give you a chance to brush up on your C programming basics and to take a look at how memory allocation works in a program. This assignment has 3 questions in total - each of the first two questions require you to submit a program written in C, and the last question would require you to do some reading and submit a report (PDF).

### Submission Format

The evaluation for the first two questions will be automated, hence, make sure that your solution files (`q1.c`, `q2.c`, `q3_report.pdf`) strictly follow this directory structure.
